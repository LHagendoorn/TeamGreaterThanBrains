In this folder, you can put the submissionfiles for the validationset, from models trained on the trainset (note, not traindata!).
- 'old': submissionfiles using the 'old' tuning version, in which too low probabilities are made higher.
- 'clean': the raw probabilities of your model.
- 'best': the best submission for the validationset, that we will use to tune the final ensemble.
